# 1. howManyEven() is a function that makes a number positive, then calls another function to see if the number is positive and subtracts one and repeats the cycle.
# howManyEven(9) = returns 3
# 2.isOdd(3) returns true because the remainder of 3/2 = non-zero
# 3. Complete
# 4. n=int(3/4) can be represented by 3 // 4 which is floor division

# input: a number
# output: the number of even numbers between that number and 0 (including 0 and the number)
