#def marvelNumber(num):
# '''
#     A marvel number is a positive integer that is equal to the
#     sum of its proper divisors. The smallest marvel number is 6,
#     which is the sum of 1, 2, and 3. In other words, a marvel number is a
#     number where all of the numbers it is divisible by *OTHER THAN ITSELF*
#     added up equal the number â€“ this does include 1.
#
#
#     If the number is a marvel number the function should return True, if it is not
#     the function should return False.
#
#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     num : int
#
#     Returns
#     -------
#     boolean
#         True if num is a marvel number
#         False if num is not a marvel number
#
#     Tip: You may want to use some sort of loop to find all
#     of the possible divisors and do your adding as you find
#     divisors, not at the very end.
